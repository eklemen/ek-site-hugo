While most of the work I do is behind private repos, here are some projects that I occupy myself with outside of business hours.

### hungry-backspace
A simple extension for the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor. The reason for making this extension is two-fold. Firstly, I wanted this behavior for myself and realized maybe others might as well. The other reason being I wanted something open source that the community can use and give feedback on.

### Angular 2 Gallery
This is a single page app build with Angular 2. While using Angular2 could be seen as overkill for a simple website, I took the opportunity to learn a new framework. By using Angular 2 I also gained a familiarity with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as well as the concept of Observables/Streams with [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/).

### My Personal Site
You are already looking at it! This site was build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator built on [GoLang](https://golang.org/). While I did not do any coding for the static site, I did utilize [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Lambda function to trigger a build when new changes are pushed to S3. This was taken from [this](http://bezdelev.com/post/hugo-aws-lambda-static-website/) post.

### Other ToDo apps
At work I learned the basics of how to build a php API using the [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) framework and decided to take what I learned and create a simple ToDo application. The application is Symfony API connected to a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database. Coming soon: Round out this app with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on the front end... maybe I should add this to my ToDo list ðŸ¤”

I also worked with a former classmate/co-worker to build a ToDo app with [Ruby on Rails API](http://rubyonrails.org/) (also utilizing MySQL and a React front end). The main purpose of building this was to share my knowledge of React and in return gain an understanding of a Rails application.
