Hello, my name is Evan Klemen. Back in early 2014 I attended Iron Yard here in Orlando Florida, and since then have been furthering my career as a developer. Even when I'm not at work I can be found on the computer fiddling with some new tech I heard about, building a Raspberry Pi project, or meeting up with peers to discuss what we've been working on. The internet is pretty neat and all, but I also make time to spend with my lovely fiance Jane (even though sometimes she has to pry me from the keyboard) and our dog Riley. [Let's grab a beer and talk code sometime.](http://evanklemen.com/#contact)
