      <description>Document your s#!t Scenario: You set up a new project on your machine, run into problems, missing packages, installation errors, system configs, etc. So you spend time Googling and finally get all up and running. Once the project is finally up, you are so ready to actually get started working you never make notes of the small trolls that stand in your way.
Fast forward a couple weeks/months and you are helping a friend or coworker set up this project on their machine, or just trying to reinstall on another machine of your own.</description>

      <description>Intro Hugo is a static site generator, not unlike Jekyll or one of the many others out there. There&amp;rsquo;s a decent number of themes to choose from, and the simplicity to get a functioning site up and running in such little time/effor made this an appealing choice. The appeal of a static site generator is that the build files are&amp;hellip; well static. This keeps hosting cheap, and you generally don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about security breaches cough wordpress.</description>
